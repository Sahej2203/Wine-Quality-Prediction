# Wine Quality Prediction Project

## Overview

Welcome to the Wine Quality Prediction Project repository, a part of my internship at Bharat Intern. In this project, I've applied data science and machine learning techniques to predict the quality of wines based on various attributes. This README provides an overview of the project and instructions to explore and reproduce the results.

## Project Objective

The primary objective of this project was to develop a predictive model capable of assessing the quality of wines using various attributes, such as acidity, residual sugar, alcohol content, and more. By thoroughly analyzing and understanding the relationships between these features and wine quality, I aimed to create an accurate model for predicting wine ratings.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `data/`: This directory contains the dataset used for both training and evaluation.
- `notebooks/`: In this directory, you'll find Jupyter notebooks used for various project stages, including data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `models/`: Here, you can access the trained machine learning models that were developed during the project.
- `src/`: This directory houses source code and utility scripts essential for data processing and model evaluation.
- `README.md`: The file you're currently reading, providing an overview of the project.

## Getting Started

To get started and replicate the results of this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary Python dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Navigate to the `notebooks/` directory to explore the Jupyter notebooks.
4. Begin by running the preprocessing notebook to clean and prepare the dataset.
5. Proceed to train and evaluate the predictive model using the provided notebooks.

Feel free to modify the code, experiment with different algorithms, and fine-tune parameters to enhance the model's predictive performance.

## Acknowledgments

I would like to express my gratitude to Bharat Intern for providing me with the opportunity to work on this enlightening project. Successfully predicting wine quality has been a valuable learning experience, and I'm delighted to have achieved this milestone.
